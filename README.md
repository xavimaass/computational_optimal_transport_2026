# Computational Optimal Transport (MATH-528)

This is the official repository for the Computational Optimal Transport Course at EPFL.

The folder `assignments` contains the assignments for the course, which will be continually updated as the semester progresses.

We recommend doing the assignments in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for simplicity; and all assignments have an [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/) button to open them there directly. Beware that you have to **make a copy** of the notebook on your own Google Account in order to be able to modify it and save your progress. This can be done simply by going to `File -> Save a copy in Drive`.

However, if you rather work locally, the repository is set up using `uv`, which is a modern tool for managing dependencies in Python projects. To learn more, visit [their website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

To install all required dependencies (**only if you want to work locally**), simply run
```bash
uv sync
```
